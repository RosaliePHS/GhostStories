Hey there, Bahktiar. 

I'd like to share with you about my program of study called *Ghost Stories*. 

Origin of Ghost Stories

*Ghost Stories* has a few points of origins for me, and so I'll begin by describing those to you:

ðŸ‘»  Evocative Objects + Encounters/Excursions day

ðŸ‘»  Angel Island + Maxine Hong Kingston

ðŸ‘»  The Body Keeps Score + my appendix bursting + vertigo 

Although these are three different , but Inside I could feel that there was a powerful connection between these ideas, that they lived under the same roof in my heart, but it took me a while to articulate that connection. Here is my first pancake at putting language to my POS.

Once that little baby was birthed, other folks' ideas/projects that I love and am moved by began to stand out to me as in alignment with my POS. Some these projects I already knew about and they reemerged in mind in working on Ghost Stories. Other projects I just recently discovered while researching the themes of Ghost Stories, and through recommendations from friends and colleagues who I shared the idea of Ghost Stories with.
