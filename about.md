## Why I am Drawn to Ghosts 

I have always been drawn to the weird and the eerie since childhood. I love how odd things seem to have a presence. From the beautiful [a jewelry box filled with gaudy, begemmed pins, dusty pearl necklaces, and kaleidoscopic rings; lace doilies over my mothers bruised wooden end tables] to the quirky [tiny animal statuettes, my grandfather’s kitchy collection of colorful and bizzare banks, the laundry chute down to our basement which I miraculously survived cohabitating with through childhood] to the grotesque [a barrel of dismembered doll heads and legs, the alligator singing in All Dogs Go To Heaven, my mother’s overflowing ashtray], these things felt real to me growing up, like they were friends who understood me. If it’s true that ‘it takes a village to raise a child’, then these objects/spaces/atmospheres were the locals. 

## What do you mean by ghost?

- Evocative Objects, or things that have a spirit, a presence, and haunting nature to them, is one way to define ghosts.

- Invisible Forces that silently shape our personal lives, our culture, and our world. This could include social/political histories and systemic issues as well as personal and familial histories that have driving force in our lives yet often go unseen.

- Metaphor for the weight of the past. This idea feels particularly rich to me as a way to explore themes like identity, history, geography, health, culture, government, etc. 

- The weird and the eerie. The creepy yet fun feeling of haunted houses, museum of oddities and horror movies.


## A Collection of Questions

- What haunts us? As individuals, as a community, as a nation? 

- What makes a physical object or space have a presence? 

- How do ghosts delight us, intrigue us, frighten us, influence us? How is the metaphor of ghosts related to history, to memory, to time, to place?

- What ghosts do we encounter when we retrace our roots?

- What ghosts do our bodies hold?
